            <p>
              Hi there, I’m Anna! The heart and hands behind Love & Co. Embroidery.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a love for thoughtful details and meaningful keepsakes has grown into a small business dedicated to creating custom embroidered pieces that feel personal, timeless, and made just for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I’m not behind the embroidery machine, you’ll usually find me sipping on a good cup of coffee, baking something in my kitchen, or soaking up time with the people I love most. I’m inspired by slow moments, soft colors, and the beauty found in simple, intentional details.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Love & Co. Embroidery, it’s always about the little things, because those are the ones that matter most. Every piece is created with care, creativity, and a whole lot of love, so it feels just as special as the moment it’s meant for. 🤍🪡💌✨
